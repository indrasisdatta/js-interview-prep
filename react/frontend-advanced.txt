1. What is PWA?
   - can be installed on device and work offline
   - all static assets (part of build files) are cached so that page loads faster on subsequent visits
   - updates are downloaded in the background

2. What are service workers?
   - Script that runs independently in the browser background
   - commonly used in 'offline first' applications
   - Uses: Background sync, push notifications

3. What are CSR, SSR, CSG?
   Ref: https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bXHuAxci--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8onh7r5sxmss9f87k726.png
   - CSR: initially loads empty HTML file, then JS and CSS are loaded. 
           Users see blank screen initially. Also, it's not SEO friendly.
   - SSR: each page initiates request to app server, dynamically renders and serves HTML.
          Advantages: better performance, SEO friendly.
   - SSG: instead of rendering pages on every request, generate files in build time so that they are server immediately.
          Useful for static pages eg. blog.
   - ISR: Incremental Static Regeneration is the next improvement to SSG. 
          Periodically builds and revalidates new pages so that content never gets too much outdated.
          Use static generation on a per page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site.
