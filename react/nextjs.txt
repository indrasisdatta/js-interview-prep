1. Next.js features:
   - SSR
   - SSG
   - File system based routing
   - Automatic code splitting
   - API routes
   - Image optimization 
   - Middleware (eg. conditional redirect)

useSWR - used in CSR for data fetching (with data, error, isLoading).
hook based light-weight library for API call, which provides caching and data fetching.

useSWR v/s React Query:
React query is a larger library that provides more advanced features for pagination, polling, data refetching and handling errors. It also provides tools for data optimizing performance of data fetching eg. batching and deduplication.

getServerSideProps
getStaticProps - static. Use revalidate for ISR.

SERVER AND CLIENT COMPOSITION PATTERNS

How to include server component within a client component? (Interleaving client and server component)
 - By default, all components called in a client component file are treated as client components.

Incorrect Approach:
"use client"
....
return (
  <>
    <ServerComp />  // --- this is not allowed
  </>
)

Correct Approach:  Use children prop in ClientComp to render Server comp code
// page.tsx
<ClientComp>
    <ServerComp />
</ClientComp>

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns

npm i server-only
import 'server-only'
export async function getData () {
  // API call to run on server
}

Client Component that imports getData() will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.
