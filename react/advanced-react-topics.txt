1. React advanced hooks 
   a) useDeferredValue  https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue
   b) useTransition https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-04/use-transition
      -> useDeferredValue is suited for optimizing rendering (show old content while fresh content is loading)
      -> useTransition gives lower priority to state updates written within startTransition to prevent blocking
   c) useId (Assign unique id to div etc when component is called multiple times)
   d) useImperativeHandle (Expose only few methods/custom methods from child component's forwardRef)

   e) useInsertionEffect
   f) useLayoutEffect
