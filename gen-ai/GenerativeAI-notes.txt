    -> Deep learning (specialized branch of ML which focuses on multi-layered neural network)
        -> Generative AI
           - Transformer architecture consisting of auto-encoders and decoders
           - Encoders encode raw i/p data into compact latent representation vector
           - Decoders translate vectors to meaningful data
