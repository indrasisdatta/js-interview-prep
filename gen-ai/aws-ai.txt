Amazon Q Business:
 - faster integrations with enterprise systems and data repositories
 - alignment with existing user access controls for enterprise data
 - reduces the time spent on coding to create a generative AI-powered digital assistant

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
  - technique to retrieve data outside a foundation model & augments the prompts by adding relevant retrieved data as context 
  - this helps gen AI based digital assistants to provide tailored response, by augmenting enterprise data source to FM 
  - admin can configure Amazon Q to respond strictly from enterprise docs or allow external knowledge if not available in the doc 

Gen AI for images from text - Diffusion models (eg. Stable diffusion)
Training is done by forward diffusion process (image to noise)
Generating: reverse diffusion process o/p "Cat with a computer" 

Amazon Bedrock ( build GenAI apps on AWS)
 - makes a copy of the FM, available only to us, which we can further fine tune with our own data 

Amazon Titan - High performing FM from AWS

Instruction based fine-tuning uses labeled examples that are prompt-response pairs
Fine tuning is a specific kind of Transfer Learning 

Bedrock RAG 
 - Search for relevant info in Knowledge Base (backed by Vector DB)
 - Retrieval text - Knowledge base returns relevant information 
 - Augmented Prompt (Query + Retrieval Text) passed to FM
 - FM generates response 

RAG Vector DB - OpenSearch Service (serverless), Aurora, MongoDB 
S3 docs are chunked and fed to Embedding Models -> generates Vectors and placed in Vector DB 

RAG Data Sources - S3, Confluence, Sharepoint, Salesforce, Web pages  

Tokenization - converting raw text into sequence of tokens 

Context Window (first factor to look at when considering a model)
 - no. of tokens an LLM can consider while generating text 
 - Large context window means more info 
 - Large context window requires more memory and processing power 

Guardrails 
 - filter harmful and undesirable content 
 - remove PII 

Agents
 - configured to perform certain pre-defined action groups 
 - Leverage RAG to retrieve info when needed
