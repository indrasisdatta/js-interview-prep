ML Terms:

GPT (Generate Pretrained Transformer)
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation for Transformers)
GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) - models used to generate synthetic data such as images, videos or sounds that resemble the training data. Helpful for data augmentation.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) - sequential data like time series or text, speech recognition 
ResNet (Residual Network) - Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image recognition, object detection, facial recognition 
SVM (Support Vector Machine)
WaveNet 

Reinforcement Learning

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
  - technique to retrieve data outside a foundation model & augments the prompts by adding relevant retrieved data as context 
  - this helps gen AI based digital assistants to provide tailored response, by augmenting enterprise data source to FM 
  - admin can configure Amazon Q to respond strictly from enterprise docs or allow external knowledge if not available in the doc 

Gen AI for images from text - Diffusion models (eg. Stable diffusion)
Training is done by forward diffusion process (image to noise)
Generating: reverse diffusion process o/p "Cat with a computer" 

Bias:
 - diff or error b/w predicted and actual value (occurs due to wrong choice of ML process)
 - High bias (considered as underfitting)
 - To reduce bias use a more complex model or increase the no. of features 

Variance:
 - amount by which the performance of a predictive model changes when it's trained on different subsets of datasets 

Ideal case - low bias and low variance 

Confusion matrix - actual v/s predicted value 
 - reduce no. of false positives and false negatives 
 - Metrics: Precision, recall, F1, accuracy 

Regression Metrics: MAE, MAPE, RMSE, R square

Inferencing - predictions on new data 

Hyperparameters:
 - Learning rate 
 - Batch size 
 - No. of epochs 

Comprehend - Named Entity recognition 


========================================================================

Amazon Bedrock ( build GenAI apps on AWS)
 - makes a copy of the FM, available only to us, which we can further fine tune with our own data 

Amazon Titan - High performing FM from AWS

Instruction based fine-tuning uses labeled examples that are prompt-response pairs
Fine tuning is a specific kind of Transfer Learning 

Bedrock RAG 
 - Search for relevant info in Knowledge Base (backed by Vector DB)
 - Retrieval text - Knowledge base returns relevant information 
 - Augmented Prompt (Query + Retrieval Text) passed to FM
 - FM generates response 

RAG Vector DB - OpenSearch Service (serverless), Aurora, MongoDB 
S3 docs are chunked and fed to Embedding Models -> generates Vectors and placed in Vector DB 

RAG Data Sources - S3, Confluence, Sharepoint, Salesforce, Web pages  

Tokenization - converting raw text into sequence of tokens 

Context Window (first factor to look at when considering a model)
 - no. of tokens an LLM can consider while generating text 
 - Large context window means more info 
 - Large context window requires more memory and processing power 

Guardrails 
 - filter harmful and undesirable content 
 - remove PII 

Agents
 - configured to perform certain pre-defined action groups 
 - Leverage RAG to retrieve info when needed 

Provisioned throughput 
 - purchase model units for a certain time (6 months)
 - throughput is max no. of input/output tokens per minute 

Prompt = Instructions + Context + Input Data + Output indicator 

Prompt performance optimization: 
 - Temperature: creativity of the model's output 
 - Top P: higher means consider a broad range of diverse words 
 - Top K: limits the no. of probable words 
 - Length: max length of the answer 

Amazon Q Business:
 - faster integrations with enterprise systems and data repositories
 - alignment with existing user access controls for enterprise data
 - reduces the time spent on coding to create a generative AI-powered digital assistant
 - built on Amazon bedrock (but FM can't be changed)
 - Authenticated through IAM identity center 

Amazon Q Developer 
 - Real time code suggestions (similar to Github Copilot)
