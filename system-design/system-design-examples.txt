LIVE STREAMING APPLICATION

RTMP (highly quality video)
WebRTC (loses some data but useful for live streaming)

How to convert raw data (8K) and serve to customers (480p, 720p)?
Transformation service to convert to different resolutions 

h.264 

Map reduce design pattern 
Break raw video into segments of 10 sec and send it to multiple servers 
  S1, S2, S3 

MPEG - DASH (depending on the bandwidth, video quality is adjusted)
Cache last 10 sec video in DB

User actions:
- Play video at timestamp x
- Pause video (buffer next 10 sec from last seek point)
- After logout and login, resume from earlier viewed timestamp 

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) also known as MPEG-DASH 
 - adaptive bitrate streaming technique 
 - enable high quality streaming of media content delivered over the internet 
 - delivered from conventional HTTP server 

(Exponential backoff at TCP)
