RADIO Concept

1) Requirements (functional and non-functional)
2) Architecture/HLD
3) Data model 
4) Interface definition (API)
5) Optimization

API Rate limiting strategies:
1. Token Bucket - allows for burst traffic by saving tokens 
   Eg. video streaming, large uploads
   Scenario: Ecommerce app launches a sale. Normally it receives 100 req/sec but during sales, it receives 1000/sec.
   Allow a short burst of up to 500 req/sec (using saved tokens).
   Once the burst capacity is exhausted, new req are queued or rate-limited.
2. Leaky Bucket - rate limiting for APIs where requests are served at a steady, fixed rate regarless of traffic spikes (Excess requests are dropped).
   Scenario. set up API to handle 100 req per sec.
   If 150 requests are made, the remaining 50 are dropped.

====================================================================

How to handle sudden high traffic? Eg. Flipkart Sale start at 10am

ASG takes time to horizontally scale and spin up new instances, do health checks and get it ready (1-2 mins).
Traffic during these 1-2 mins are not handled and also increases the bill.

Better Solution: To build a highly scalable system, offload non-critical async tasks to Quueue

Critical tasks - place order (handle synchronously)
Non-critical tasks - send email (handle asyncronously)

Message Queue (Amazon SQS, Kafka) <- Consumer 
(Consumer pulls messsages. Set up rate limiter and concurrency control)
