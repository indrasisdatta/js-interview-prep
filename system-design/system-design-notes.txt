API Rate limiting strategies:
1. Token Bucket - allows for burst traffic by saving tokens 
   Eg. video streaming, large uploads
   Scenario: Ecommerce app launches a sale. Normally it receives 100 req/sec but during sales, it receives 1000/sec.
   Allow a short burst of up to 500 req/sec (using saved tokens).
   Once the burst capacity is exhausted, new req are queued or rate-limited.
2. Leaky Bucket - rate limiting for APIs where requests are served at a steady, fixed rate regarless of traffic spikes (Excess requests are dropped).
   Scenario. set up API to handle 100 req per sec.
   If 150 requests are made, the remaining 50 are dropped.
