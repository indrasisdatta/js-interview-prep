1. What is PWA?
   - can be installed on device and work offline
   - all static assets (part of build files) are cached so that page loads faster on subsequent visits
   - updates are downloaded in the background

2. What are service workers?
   - Script that runs independently in the browser background
   - commonly used in 'offline first' applications
   - Uses: Background sync, push notifications

3. What are CSR, SSR, CSG?
   Ref: https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bXHuAxci--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8onh7r5sxmss9f87k726.png
   - CSR: initially loads empty HTML file, then JS and CSS are loaded. 
           Users see blank screen initially. Also, it's not SEO friendly.
   - SSR: each page initiates request to app server, dynamically renders and serves HTML.
          Advantages: better performance, SEO friendly.
   - SSG: instead of rendering pages on every request, generate files in build time so that they are server immediately.
          Useful for static pages eg. blog.
   - ISR: Incremental Static Regeneration is the next improvement to SSG. 
          Periodically builds and revalidates new pages so that content never gets too much outdated.
          Use static generation on a per page basis, without needing to rebuild the entire site.  

4. How to ensure cross-browser compatibility?
5. Discuss the importance of accessibility in web development
6. Compare and contrast client-side and server-side state management approaches in web development. 
   When would you choose one over the other?
7. How to use automated testing in frontend? End to end testing using Cypress/Selenium?
8. Real time updates - sockets etc.

WEB VITALS: standardized metrics set by Google (in 2020) that quantify user experience of a website. 

CORE WEB VITALS: 3 aspects of UX (loading, interactivity, visual stability).
1. Largest contentful paint (LCP) - within 2.5 secs
   => Measures by calculating the time taken to load the largest image/text content since the page first started loading 
2. Interaction to next paint (INP) - within 200ms
   => Checks latency of click, tap, keyboard interactions thoughout the lifespan of user's visit to a page.
3. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) - 0.1 or less	
   => CLS measures how much content elements move around as the page loads. 
      Eg. a poor CLS score would result if a user were reading a page and suddenly a banner loaded and the page jumped down.

First contentful paint: < 1.8s 
First input delay: time takes for a webpage to respond to first user interaction eg. button click (< 100ms)

Next.js improves:
LCP (SSR, image optimization)
SEO
